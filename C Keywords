auto                                declare automatic variables. Automatc is a local variable which is allocated
                                    and deallocated automatically when program flow enters and leaves the variable
                                    scope. Scop is the lexical context particularly the function block in which
                                    the variable is defined
  
break & continue                    break: makes the program jump out of the innermost loop (while, do for, switch)
                                    explicitly

switch, case, default               Switch and case are used when the block of statements has to be executed among many
                                    blocks
                                     
char                                 declares a character variable. It is one byte

const                                an identifier can be declared constant by using constant keyword. It is user defined
                                     an identifier is a string of alphanueric characters that begins with an alphatical 
                                     character of an underlined character that are used to represent various program
                                     elements, varaibles, functions, arrays structures
                                     
if & else                            used to make decisions

enum                                 declared in C programming using keyword enum. User defined data type. 
                                     used to declare new enumerical types

extern                               declares that a variable or a function has external linkages outside of its declared

for                                  it is a loop

goto                                  used for unconditional jump to a labeled statement inside a function

int                                   declares integer type variable

short, long, signed, unsigned         type modifiers that alters the meaning of a base data type to yield a new type.
                                      a modifier is used to alter the meaning of the base type so that it is precisely
                                      fits the needs of various situations
                                      
return                                terminates the funtion and returns the value

sizeof                                evaluates the size of data (a variable of a constant)

register                              creates register variables which are much faster than normal variables
                                      it hints that a given variable can be put in a register
                                      
static                                creates a static variable.the value of a static variable persists until the end
                                      end of the program
                                      
struct                                used for declaring a structure. A structure can hold variables of different types
                                      under a single name
                                      
typedef                               used to explicitly associate a type with an identifier

union                                 used for grouping differet types of variables under a single name

void                                  indicates that a function doesn't return any value

volatile                              used for creating a volatile object. a volatile object can be modified
                                      in an unspeciied way by the hardware
